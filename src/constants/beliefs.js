      "Man’s only hope of redemption is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ the Son of God. Salvation is received through repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord Jesus Christ. By the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, being justified by grace through faith, man becomes an heir of God, according to the hope of eternal life (Luke 24:47; John 3:3; Romans 10:13-15; Ephesians 2:8; Titus 2:11; Titus 3:5-7). The inward evidence of salvation is the direct witness of the Spirit (Romans 8:16). The outward evidence to all men is a life of righteousness and true holiness (Ephesians 4:24; Titus 2:12).",

His ministry upon the earth is to convict and covert man as well as be the great paraclete (comforter, counselor, helper, intercessor, advocate, strengthener and standby) to the Church. The baptism of the Holy Spirit and Fire is a gift from God as promised by the Lord Jesus to all believers and is received subsequent to and is distinct from the experience of New Birth. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the bestowment of the gifts and their uses in the work of the ministry (Luke 24:29; Acts 1:4; 1:8; 1 Corinthians 12:1-31). The Baptism of the Holy Spirit is meant to empower the believer to be a witness of Jesus Christ by the preaching and demonstration of the Gospel. The gifts of the Holy Spirit are also evidence of this experience. Whereas there is one initial baptism, there are many subsequent infillings of the Spirit. The ultimate purpose of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit is so that we, the believers, may have power to be witnesses (Matthew 3:11; John 14:16-17; Acts 1:8; Acts 2).",
